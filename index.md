## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a PhD student at the **College of Land Science and Technology, China Agricultural University (CAU)**, Beijing. Under the supervision of **Professor Yelu Zeng**, my research focuses on the frontiers of **Quantitative Remote Sensing**. 

I am passionate about bridge-building between physical radiative transfer mechanisms and satellite observations to better understand terrestrial vegetation dynamics. Currently, I also serve as a professional reviewer for **Remote Sensing of Environment (RSE)**.

## 核心研究方向 | Research Interests

My academic work integrates multi-source remote sensing data and physical models:
* **Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF)**: Exploring SIF mechanisms and its coupling with photosynthesis.
* **3D Radiative Transfer Modeling**: Extensive experience with **SCOPE** and **LESS** models for canopy simulation.
* **Soil-Background Decoupling**: Developing algorithms to minimize soil influence in vegetation parameter retrieval.
* **Quantitative Analysis**: Proficiency in data processing and algorithm implementation using **MATLAB**.

## 📢 News

* **[Feb. 2026]** Updated personal academic homepage using Minimal Mistakes.
* **[Oct. 2025]** Served as a **co-organizer** for the "Remote Sensing Mechanisms" session at the Academic Salon.

## 🎓 Education

* **PhD in Land Science and Technology**, China Agricultural University, 2020 – Present.
* **BS in Geographic Information Science**, Northwest A&F University (Resource and Environment College), 2016 – 2020.

## 📝 Publications & Patents

To date, I have authored **3 SCI papers** (including 1 as the first author) and applied for **1 National Invention Patent**.
