## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a PhD student at **China Agricultural University (CAU)**, Beijing. Under the supervision of Prof. Yelu Zeng, my research focuses on the frontiers of **Quantitative Vegetation Remote Sensing**. 

I am passionate about bridge-building between physical radiative transfer mechanisms and satellite observations to better understand terrestrial vegetation dynamics.

## Research Interests

My academic work integrates multi-source remote sensing data and physical models:
* **Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF)**: Exploring SIF mechanisms and its coupling with photosynthesis.
* **3D Radiative Transfer Modeling**: Extensive experience with **Canopy-SIP** and **LESS** models for canopy simulation.
* **Soil-Background Decoupling**: Developing algorithms to minimize soil influence in vegetation parameter retrieval.
* **Quantitative Analysis**: Proficiency in data processing and algorithm implementation using **MATLAB**.

## 📢 News

* **[Feb. 2026]** Deployed an updated academic website on GitHub. The site utilizes the Minimal Mistakes framework and was refined with the support of AI tools.

## 🎓 Education

* **PhD in Land Science and Technology**, China Agricultural University, 2022 – Present.
* **BS in Geographic Information Science**, Northwest A&F University, 2018 – 2022.

## 📝 Publications & Patents

To date, I have authored **4 SCI papers** (including 1 as the first author) and applied for **1 National Invention Patent**.
